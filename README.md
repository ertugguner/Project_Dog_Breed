# Muilti-Class Dog Breed Classification: Project Overview
- Create an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using Deep Learning
- The data I'am using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.
https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data
- I completed this project with what I learned from this course:
https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/
- There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).
- There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).
- There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them).

Python Version : 3.7

Packages: TensorFlow 2.0, TensorFlow Hub, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
